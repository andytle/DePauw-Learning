# DePauw Learning

Repo to hold all of the ITAP 2019-2020 code.

## Getting Started

To clone the repo, go to a directory where you want to add the repo and type:

```
git clone https://github.com/jparenas/DePauw-Learning.git
```

It will download all of the files in the repo.

### Prerequisites

To install, you need two things:

[Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk12-downloads-5295953.html)

[NodeJS + NPM](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-install-and-use-node-js-and-npm-mac-and-windows/)

### Installing

TBD

## Development

Always begin with pulling the latest version from Git.

```
git pull
```

### Start new branch

To start a new branch:

```
git checkout -b [name_of_the_new_branch]
```

Then do all the commits you need on that branch.

To push the branch to GitHub:

```
git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

To merge the current branch to "master":

```
git merge
```

Commiting to "master" is disabled, that way we get used to code reviews.
